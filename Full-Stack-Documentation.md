# BeaBeaCallMe — Full Stack Reference

> **Version:** v2.0.0
> **Last Updated:** 2026-06-30
> **Repo:** https://github.com/dustin-siler-cloud/BeaBeaCallMe
> **Purpose:** Self-hosted IVR voicemail so Bea (age 5) can call a Twilio number from her Tin Can kids' phone and leave voicemails that save to Google Drive.

---

## Monthly Costs

| Service | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Twilio phone number** | ~$1.15/mo | Required — inbound voice number |
| **Twilio inbound calls** | ~$0.0085/min | Negligible at typical usage (a few short calls/mo) |
| **Cloudflare Tunnel** | Free | Named tunnel, no bandwidth cap for this use case |
| **Google Drive** | Free | Storage via existing Google account |
| **GitHub** | Free | Public repo |
| **Tin Can Party Line** | $9.99/mo | **Optional** — subscription that enables the Tin Can kids' phone to make outbound calls; this project works with any phone as long as its number is `BEA_CALLER_ID` or in `FRIEND_CALLERS` |

**Estimated required spend: ~$1.15/mo.** The Tin Can subscription is optional and independent of this project.

## Architecture Overview

Any inbound caller hits Twilio → Twilio posts to `/call` → the app looks up the caller's role (`bea`, `friend`, or rejected) and plays a role-specific menu. Bea's menu offers voicemail (1) and a group call (6); the friend menu offers voicemail only (1). Voicemails are downloaded, saved locally, uploaded to a role-specific Google Drive subfolder, logged to SQLite, and trigger a Slack notification. The group call drops Bea into a Twilio conference room and dials out to configured participants.

## Infrastructure

### Docker

| Component | Image | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **App** | `python:3.13-slim` | Flask IVR app + GDrive uploader |
| **cloudflared** | `cloudflare/cloudflared:2026.6.1` | Cloudflare tunnel connector |

**Compose:**
- `docker-compose.yml` — two services: `app` (port bound to `127.0.0.1:8080`) and `cloudflared` (tunnel connector). `./data` volume for SQLite persistence, `gdrive-credentials.json` mounted read-only from a local path outside the Google Drive virtual filesystem (avoids Docker bind-mount issues with virtual drives).

**Non-root container user:**
The app runs as `appuser` (no password, no shell). An `entrypoint.sh` script runs first as root to `chown /app/data` to `appuser` (the bind-mounted `./data` volume arrives owned by root), then uses Python's `os.setuid`/`os.setgid` to drop privileges before exec-ing gunicorn. No external privilege-drop utility is required, avoiding Go stdlib CVEs that would otherwise appear in container scans.

**Start/rebuild:**
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
```

### Networking

| Exposure | How |
|---|---|
| Public HTTPS | Cloudflare named tunnel (outbound-only, no open ports) |
| App port | `127.0.0.1:8080` (localhost-only bind) |
| TLS | Terminated by Cloudflare edge |

### Cloudflare Tunnel

A named Cloudflare tunnel runs as a Docker service alongside the app. The `cloudflared` container connects outbound to Cloudflare's edge and routes your public hostname → `http://app:8080` (Docker service name). No open inbound ports required. Token stored in `.env` as `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN`.

## Backend Stack

### Runtime

| Component | Version | Purpose | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Python** | 3.13 | Runtime | https://docs.python.org/3.13/ |
| **Flask** | 3.1.3 | Web framework | https://flask.palletsprojects.com/ |
| **Gunicorn** | latest | WSGI server (2 workers, 60s timeout) | https://docs.gunicorn.org/ |
| **python-dotenv** | 1.2.2 | `.env` loading | https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv |

### Twilio

| Component | Version | Purpose | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **twilio** | 9.10.9 | Twilio REST client + TwiML builder | https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python |
| **requests** | 2.34.2 | Download recordings from Twilio | https://docs.python-requests.org/ |

**Caller Roles (`app/utils/caller_role.py`):**

Every inbound call is classified before any menu plays:
- `bea` — caller matches `BEA_CALLER_ID` exactly
- `friend` — caller is in `FRIEND_CALLERS` (comma-separated)
- unrecognized — call is rejected via `<Reject>` before hearing any menu

**IVR Flow (`app/routes/`):**

| Route | Blueprint | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /call` | `ivr` | Entry point — classifies caller role, plays role-specific menu (`bea`: press 1 or 6; `friend`: press 1 only) |
| `POST /call/route` | `ivr` | Routes digit by role: `1` → `/voicemail` (either role); `6` → `/conference` (`bea` only); anything else re-prompts |
| `POST /voicemail` | `voicemail` | Says "leave a message after the beep", starts `<Record>` |
| `POST /voicemail/done` | `voicemail` | Hangs up |
| `POST /voicemail/callback` | `voicemail` | Downloads WAV → local disk → Google Drive (role-specific subfolder) → SQLite log → Slack notification → delete from Twilio |
| `POST /conference` | `conference` | Bea joins a Twilio conference room; app dials out to `CONFERENCE_PARTICIPANTS` |
| `POST /conference/join` | `conference` | TwiML answered by each outbound participant leg — joins the same conference room |

**Security headers (`app/utils/security_headers.py`):**

Applied to every response via `app.after_request`:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `no-referrer` |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'none'` |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` |

**Request validation:** All routes are decorated with `@validate_twilio_request` (`app/utils/twilio_validator.py`) — verifies the `X-Twilio-Signature` header against `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` to reject spoofed requests.

**IVR Greeting Audio (`app/utils/audio_shuffle.py`):**

IVR greeting MP3 clips are hosted on Twilio Assets (visibility: Protected) at the URL configured in `TWILIO_ASSET_BASE`. There are two independent clip sets and shuffle queues, one per caller role:
- `TWILIO_GREETING_CLIPS` — Bea's menu (mentions both voicemail and group call options)
- `TWILIO_FRIEND_GREETING_CLIPS` — friend menu (voicemail option only, no Bea-specific content)

Clips were generated using [fish.audio](https://fish.audio/app). Each shuffle queue exhausts all its clips before repeating, resetting on container restart. Source MP3 files are stored locally outside the repo (not committed).

**Group Call (`app/routes/conference.py`):**

When Bea presses 6, the app drops her into a named Twilio conference room (`<Dial><Conference>`) and places outbound calls via the Twilio REST API to every number in `CONFERENCE_PARTICIPANTS`. Each outbound leg answers with TwiML from `/conference/join`, which joins the same room. The conference ends when Bea hangs up (`end_conference_on_exit=True` on her leg only); a 10-minute hard cap (`time_limit`) prevents runaway calls. Participants who don't answer simply never join — no error surfaces to Bea.

### Google Drive

| Component | Version | Purpose | Docs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **google-api-python-client** | 2.197.0 | Drive API v3 client | https://googleapis.github.io/google-api-python-client/ |
| **google-auth** | 2.55.0 | Service account credentials | https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/ |

**Helper (`app/gdrive.py`):**
- Authenticates with a service account JSON file (scope: `drive`)
- `upload_recording(local_path, filename, folder_id)` → uploads WAV to the given subfolder, returns Drive file ID
- `driveId` (the Shared Drive root, `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID`) and `parents` (the target subfolder) are set separately — `supportsAllDrives=True` is required for both
- GDrive upload failure is non-fatal: logged as a warning, local copy kept, Twilio callback still returns 204

**Subfolders:** recordings route to one of two subfolders within the Shared Drive based on caller role:
- `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID_FROM_BEA` — voicemails Bea leaves for friends
- `GDRIVE_FOLDER_ID_TO_BEA` — voicemails friends leave for Bea

### Database (SQLite)

| File | Location |
|---|---|
| `ivr.db` | `./data/ivr.db` (inside Docker volume `./data`) |

**`recordings` table:**

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| `created_at` | TEXT | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp |
| `caller_id` | TEXT | Caller's phone number (from Twilio `From`) |
| `duration` | INTEGER | Recording length in seconds |
| `filename` | TEXT | Recording filename (e.g. `Caller-23JUN2026-4-41PM.wav`) |
| `file_size` | INTEGER | Bytes |
| `twilio_sid` | TEXT | Twilio `RecordingSid` |
| `gdrive_file_id` | TEXT | Google Drive file ID (null if upload failed) |

Recordings are saved locally under `./data/recordings/YYYY/MM/DD/` and mirrored to Drive.

### Notifications

**Slack (`app/utils/slack.py`):**

After each successful voicemail save, the app posts a message to a configured Slack channel via an incoming webhook. The message includes:
- Caller's friendly name (from `CALLER_NAMES`)
- Timestamp of the recording (Eastern time)
- Duration in seconds
- Direct link to the file in Google Drive (`https://drive.google.com/file/d/{file_id}/view`)

The webhook is configured via `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env`. If the variable is unset, notifications are silently skipped — no error is raised. Slack failures are logged as warnings and do not affect the recording save or Twilio callback response.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

Runs on every push to `main` and every pull request.

| Job | Tool | What it Checks | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dependency Audit** | `pip-audit` | CVEs in `requirements.txt` against the OSV database | PRs + main |
| **Python SAST** | `bandit` + `ruff` | Hardcoded secrets, unsafe deserialization, injection risks, code quality | PRs + main |
| **Dockerfile Lint** | `hadolint` | Dockerfile best-practice violations | PRs + main |
| **Secret Scan** | `trufflehog` | Leaked credentials in full git history (verified-only) | PRs + main |
| **Container Scan** | `grype` (Anchore) | OS-level and library CVEs in the built Docker image — fails on fixable high/critical (`only-fixed: true`) | main only |

Container scan is gated to `main`-push only (slow Docker build); all other checks run on every PR.

### Action Pins

| Action | Version |
|---|---|
| `actions/checkout` | v7 |
| `actions/setup-python` | v6 |
| `trufflesecurity/trufflehog` | v3.95.6 |
| `hadolint/hadolint-action` | v3.3.0 |
| `anchore/scan-action` | v7 |

### GitHub Security Features

| Feature | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Dependabot Alerts** | Notifies when dependencies have known CVEs |
| **Dependabot Security Updates** | Auto-opens PRs to bump vulnerable packages |
| **Dependabot Version Updates** | Weekly PRs for pip and GitHub Actions pins (grouped patch/minor) |

### External Security Scanning

[Aikido](https://aikido.dev) continuously scans `https://beabeacallme.siler.cloud` for web application vulnerabilities (missing security headers, exposed endpoints, misconfigurations, etc.).

### Uptime Monitoring

[UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) monitors `https://beabeacallme.siler.cloud/health` on the free tier (5-minute ping interval).

### Deployment Workflow

1. Create a feature branch (`feat/`, `fix/`, `ci/`, `chore/`)
2. Make changes and commit; update `Full-Stack-Documentation.md` version history
3. Push and open a PR — all checks run automatically
4. Merge PR on GitHub (never push directly to main)
5. Container scan runs on the merged main push
6. `git checkout main && git pull` on the host to fetch the merged changes
7. `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build` on the host to deploy

---
